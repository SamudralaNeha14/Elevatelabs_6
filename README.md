Data Loading and Initial Exploration: The code starts by loading the Iris dataset using pandas. It then performs basic data exploration, including:

    Checking the shape of the DataFrame.
    Examining data types and identifying the target variable ('Species').
    Checking for missing values.
    Analyzing and visualizing the distribution of the target variable.
    Calculating and visualizing descriptive statistics for numerical features.
    Calculating and visualizing the correlation matrix for numerical features.
    Encoding the 'Species' column and visualizing the correlation matrix including the encoded target.

Feature Selection and Scaling: The code prepares the data for modeling:

    Features (X) and the target variable (y) are separated.
    The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
    Features are normalized using MinMaxScaler.

KNN Model Training and Evaluation: A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is used for modeling:

    A loop iterates through different values of 'k' (the number of neighbors) to find the best performing 'k' based on accuracy.
    The KNN model is trained with the optimal 'k' value.
    The accuracy of the model on the test set is calculated and printed.
    A confusion matrix is generated and visualized as a heatmap to evaluate the model's performance in more detail.

Decision Boundary Visualization: The final part of the code focuses on visualizing the decision boundaries of the KNN classifier using only two features:

    Two features ('PetalLengthCm' and 'PetalWidthCm') are selected.
    These features are normalized.
    The data with the two selected features is split into training and testing sets.
    The 'Species' labels are encoded numerically.
    A KNN classifier is trained using only these two features and the encoded labels.
    A meshgrid is created to cover the feature space.
    The trained KNN model predicts the class for each point in the meshgrid.
    The decision boundaries are plotted using contourf, and the test data points are overlaid to show how well the model separates the classes in this 2D feature space. The legend is also correctly formatted to show the species names corresponding to the colors.
